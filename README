Installing OpenCV correctly in Ubuntu is a hell.

This is why I have created this Fabric script for setting the right dependencies and compiling OpenCV from sources.

It's far from perfect but good starting point for having OpenCV installed. 

I don't remember exactly all the websites I've read to get to this final script but thanks to all the Open Source community for their blogs, forums and documentation.
